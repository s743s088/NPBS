Non-parametric Bootstrapping Code

BEFORE USING THIS CODE:

--> Need fasta file of the transcriptome being mapped to

-->Transcripts need to be named numerically:
    - i.e. TRANSCRIPT_PREFIX_1, TRANSCRIPT_PREFIX_2, TRANSCRIPT_PREFIX_3, .... 
    - use Format_Assembly.py script to do this

-->Map raw reads to transcriptome (We used bowtie2)

-->Need a separate file that has just the Sam header from the mapping program
    - ex. Gene_ID_list.txt

Pipeline:

- run Format_Assembly.py on your assembly.
- use bowtie2 with your reformatted assembly to get .sam file 
- run the Preprocess_Map_file.py script on all of you mapping files. 
- run NPBS.cpp on all of the output files from the previous python script: should get 10 bootstrap files per text file
- run Significant_tests.py on any two libraries you wish to compare

FYI, all of these scripts require some editing depending on the TRANSCRIPT_PREFIX you chose and
the names of the input and output files used for the mapping program and in previous scripts.
